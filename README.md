# Acoustic Shooter Detection Simulation

**Status:** In Progress ðŸš§

This repository contains an experimental **p5.js** simulation of an acoustic shooter detection system.  
The project is currently in development and serves as a prototype for visualizing sound propagation and basic microphone interactions in 2D space.

## Current Features
- Interactive canvas using **p5.js**  
- Draggable microphones and sound source  
- Visualization of distances between microphones and the sound source  
- Expanding wave animation simulating sound propagation
